# CRNN_CycleDetection

Welcome to the official repository for the supplementary material accompanying our research article on using Deep Convolutional Recurrent Networks (CRNNs) for automatic cycle detection in respiratory audio. This repository is intended to provide additional resources and insights beyond those presented in the main article.

## Overview

This repository is designed to host supplementary materials that offer a deeper analysis of the database used in our study, outlining its strengths and limitations. Additionally, we will share the code and some of the trained neural networks to enable others to use and further train models based on our research.

### Content

- **Database Analysis**: Detailed documents analyzing the ICBHI 2017 database, including its advantages and limitations, will be provided.
- **Code and Models**: The repository will include the code for our CRNN-based system, along with trained models. These resources will allow other researchers to replicate our findings and extend our work by training their own networks.

### Status

At present, this repository is empty as we are in the process of preparing and uploading the materials. Please stay tuned, as these resources will be available soon.

## About the Research

Our research addresses a critical need in medical decision support by developing a novel system for automatic segmentation of respiratory cycles. The proposed CRNN system demonstrated superior performance compared to classical methods, especially in handling the variability present in the ICBHI 2017 database. The results highlight the potential of deep learning techniques in automating patient monitoring and setting benchmarks for future research.

## Stay Updated

We are actively working to make these materials available. Please watch this repository for updates.
